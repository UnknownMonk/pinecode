It allows businesses to streamline their operations, automate processes, and enhance customer experiences by providing real-time access to data from multiple systems. With web API integration, businesses can create a seamless user experience across multiple platforms, and leverage the strengths of different applications to achieve their goals. It is an essential component of modern
